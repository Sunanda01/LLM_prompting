by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and OpenAI.

A curated collection of prompt engineering strategies and techniques for working effectively with large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and others.

> 📁 Organized into practical, real-world categories like summarizing, transforming, inferring, and more.

## ✍️ Two types of Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Base LLM
  - Instruction Tuned LLM

## 🎯 Principles for Prompting

### 📌 Principle 1: Write Clear and Specific Instructions
  
#### 🔧 Tactics to Apply:
   
      - Use Delimiters
      - Ask for Structured Output
      - Check whether condition are satisfied. Check assumption required to do the task
      - Few-shot Prompting

     
  ### 📌 Principle 2: Give the model time to think

  #### 🔧 Tactics to Apply:
   
      - Specify the steps required to complete a task
      - Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

## 💡 Tips for Prompting

    - Be detailed and specific
    - Guide the model to think through its answers
    - Experiment and iterate

---

## 🔁 Prompting Process

    - Be clear and specific in prompt
    - Think about why result isn't giving desired output
    - Refine prompt
    - Repeat

## 💢 Demerit of Large Language Models (LLMs)

    - Knowledge Cutoffs
    - Making things up : HALLUCINATIONS
    - The input and output length is limited
    - Bias & Toxicity
    - Generative AI does not work well with structured data
